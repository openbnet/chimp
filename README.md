# IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - July 22nd, 2018

The Chimp that you know and love is now being split into two separate projects, both of which are intended to help you deliver higher quality faster.

The first is [*Chimpy*](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/chimpy), which will be developed and maintained by [TheBrain team](http://team.thebrain.pro). This project will continue evolving and supporting the current thinking behind Chimp 1.x. 

The second is [*Chimp 2.0*](https://github.com/xolvio/chimp), which will be developed and maintained by [Xolv.io](http://xolv.io). This project will be built from scratch based on the learnings made while using Chimp 1.x in the field.

For more details about this decision, [please see the full announcement here.](https://medium.com/@sam_hatoum/the-future-of-chimp-js-e911f8e9aaa6)

## Chimp 2.0
Chimp 2.0 will be a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) for quality. The intention is to have Chimp be your companion that you can call on to help you create high quality code that is optimized for changes


## Quality Faster
Please checkout the new [Quality Faster](http://quality.xolv.io/?utm_source=XolvOSS&utm_medium=OSSGitHub&utm_content=ChimpGitHubReadme&utm_campaign=QFLaunch) guide where you can learn how to build quality in to your application across the full stack.

Anyone that purchased The Meteor Testing Manual will get this guide for free. [See here for the announcement](https://www.qualityfaster.com/landing/meteor-testing.html).

## Timeline
Iâ€™m dedicating time to work on both Quality Faster and Chimp 2.0 from January of 2019.
